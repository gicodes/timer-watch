# Timer-watch 

- is a simple application model that runs as a timer, or watch, or both.
- takes in a number > 0, as 'user input' and it runs a countdown on the UI.
- displays *time remaining* with an animated clock-wise movement that stops at 0.
- was built with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, and helper libraries such as 'fa-', SVG.
- Can be modified to deliver a better user experience && or integrated on advanced APIs.
