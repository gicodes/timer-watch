Timer-watch 
is a simple application model that runs as a timer or watch, or both.
Receives user input (seconds) as a "props or args" and displays a countdown user-interface.
Can be modified to render a better user experience or integrated on advanced APIs.
Was build with Javascript, and helper libraries such as font-awesome and SVG.
Version was released to Github for more application insight and collaboration.
