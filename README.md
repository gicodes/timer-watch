# Timer-watch 

- is a simple application model that runs as a timer, or watch, or both.
- takes in a number > 0, as 'user input' and it runs a countdown on the UI.
- displays *time remaining* with an animated clock-wise movement that stops at 0.
- was built on Javascript, HTML & CSS with helper libraries like font-awesome and SVG.
- can be modified to deliver better user interface and experience or integrated on advanced APIs.
