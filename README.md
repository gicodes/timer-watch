Timer-watch is a simple application model that runs as a timer or watch, or both.
This app currently takes in user input (seconds) and displays a "countdown" user-interface.
It could be modified to serve better user experience, more complex applications or integrated on advanced APIs.
Timer-watch was build with Javascript, using helper libraries such as font-awesome and SVG.
This version represents the test file and is currently not deployed on any server.
